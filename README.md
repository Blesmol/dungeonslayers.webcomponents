dungeonslayers.webcomponents
============================

Web components to easily create and illustrate various things for the [Dungenslayers RPG system](http://www.dungeonslayers.net/)

A demo can be found [here](https://blesmol.github.io/dungeonslayers.webcomponents/demo.html) (but works only in Chrome at the moment, and the better if you have the WoodStamp font installed locally)
